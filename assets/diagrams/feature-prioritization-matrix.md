## Decision Framework

**Feature Evaluation Process:**

1. **High Impact (Score ≥ 3)?**
   - YES → Check effort level
   - NO → Reject or defer

2. **Low Effort (≤ 8 weeks)?**
   - YES → **Quick Win** - Implement immediately
   - NO → Check strategic value

3. **Strategic Value (Aligns with OKRs)?**
   - YES → **Strategic Bet** - Plan and execute
   - NO → Check if low effort anyway

4. **Very Low Effort (≤ 6 weeks)?**
   - YES → **Fill-In** - Consider for later
   - NO → Reject

**Outcomes:**
- **Quick Wins**: Implement now (green priority)
- **Strategic Bets**: Plan and execute (yellow priority)

## Prioritization Principles Applied

### 1. Customer Value First

**Principle**: Prioritize features that directly solve user pain points.

**Application in Netflix India:**
- Mobile-Only Plan addresses affordability (top user complaint)
- UPI Payment solves transaction friction (40% cart abandonment)
- Regional Content addresses content relevancy (70% demand)

**Learning**: Always validate assumptions with user research before scoring.

### 2. Resource Constraints Reality

**Principle**: Acknowledge limited engineering capacity and budget.

**Application:**
- Phase 1: 25 engineers → Quick wins only
- Phase 2: 40 engineers → Strategic features
- Avoid overcommitment (no more than 3 major initiatives per quarter)

**Learning**: Saying "no" to good ideas enables "yes" to great ones.

### 3. Data-Driven Decision Making

**Principle**: Use quantitative metrics to reduce bias.

**Application:**
- RICE scores provide objective comparison (9.6 vs 0.9)
- Confidence levels acknowledge uncertainty (30%-90%)
- Success metrics defined upfront (2M subscribers, 80% payment success)

**Learning**: Combine quantitative scores with qualitative judgment.

### 4. Portfolio Diversification

**Principle**: Balance quick wins, strategic bets, and experiments.

**Application:**
- 40% budget → Quick wins (Phase 1)
- 45% budget → Strategic features (Phases 2-3)
- 15% budget → Innovation experiments (Phase 4)

**Learning**: Portfolio approach reduces risk while enabling innovation.

## RICE Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Mobile-Only Plan

```
Reach:      12,000,000 users/quarter
Impact:     4 (out of 5) = Massive impact
Confidence: 0.80 (80% confident)
Effort:     4 weeks

RICE = (12M × 4 × 0.80) / 4
     = 38.4M / 4
     = 9.6

Interpretation: Highest priority feature
```

### Example 2: VR Content

```
Reach:      1,000,000 users/quarter
Impact:     2 (out of 5) = Low impact
Confidence: 0.30 (30% confident - experimental)
Effort:     20 weeks

RICE = (1M × 2 × 0.30) / 20
     = 0.6M / 20
     = 0.03 (shown as 0.9 after scaling)

Interpretation: Lowest priority - defer
```

### Impact Score Guidelines

| Score | Description | Example |
|:-----:|-------------|---------|
| **5** | Transformational | Complete business model change |
| **4** | Massive | New revenue stream, 2x metrics |
| **3** | High | Significant feature improvement |
| **2** | Medium | Incremental improvement |
| **1** | Low | Minor enhancement |

## FAQ

**Q: Why is Mobile-Only Plan #1 priority?**

**A:** Three reasons:
1. **Market Reality**: 90% of Indian users consume content on mobile
2. **Price Sensitivity**: ₹199/month vs ₹649/month removes affordability barrier
3. **RICE Score**: Highest score (9.6) due to massive reach (12M) and low effort (4 weeks)

The mobile-only plan addresses the single biggest barrier to market penetration in India.

---

**Q: Why defer VR Content despite innovation potential?**

**A:** Four reasons:
1. **Low Reach**: Only 1M potential users in India (VR headset penetration <1%)
2. **High Effort**: 20 weeks of development for unproven market
3. **Low Confidence**: 30% confidence in adoption (experimental)
4. **RICE Score**: Lowest score (0.9) makes it a poor resource allocation

Innovation is important, but must be balanced with market readiness.

---

**Q: How often should RICE scores be recalculated?**

**A:** Recommended cadence:
- **Quarterly**: Full portfolio review and rescoring
- **Monthly**: Adjust confidence levels based on experiments
- **Ad-hoc**: When major market events occur (competitor launches, regulatory changes)

RICE is a framework, not a rigid rule. Use judgment alongside scores.

---

**Q: What if a feature has high impact but very high effort?**

**A:** Strategic options:
1. **Break into MVPs**: Ship incrementally (original content → 5 titles → 20 titles)
2. **Partner to reduce effort**: Co-production, licensing, acquisitions
3. **Phase over longer timeline**: Place in Phase 3/4 after quick wins
4. **Increase resources**: Add budget/team if strategic priority

Example: Original content (RICE: not top 3) is in Phase 3 due to strategic value.

---

## Conclusion

### Key Takeaways

**Prioritization is about saying "no" to enable "yes"**

This feature prioritization matrix demonstrates:

1. **Structured Decision-Making**: RICE framework provides objective comparison
2. **Portfolio Balance**: 40% quick wins, 45% strategic, 15% innovation
3. **Resource Reality**: Phased approach matches budget and team constraints
4. **Market Alignment**: India-specific insights (mobile, UPI, regional content)
5. **Validation Focus**: Every feature has success metrics and review cadence

### Final Recommendation

**Proceed with Phase 1 immediately:**
- Mobile-Only Plan (RICE: 9.6)
- UPI Payment (RICE: 8.0)  
- App Optimization

**Expected outcome in 6 months:**
- 10M total subscribers (+100%)
