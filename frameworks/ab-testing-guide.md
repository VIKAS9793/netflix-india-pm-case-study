# A/B Testing Guide for Product Managers

## Overview
A/B testing is a method of comparing two versions of a product feature to determine which performs better. This guide provides a comprehensive framework for designing, implementing, and analyzing A/B tests.

## Key Concepts

### Hypothesis Formation
- **Null Hypothesis (H0):** No difference between versions
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** Significant difference exists
- **Statistical Significance:** Confidence level (typically 95%)
- **Power:** Ability to detect a real difference (typically 80%)

### Test Design
- **Control Group:** Current version (A)
- **Treatment Group:** New version (B)
- **Randomization:** Random assignment to groups
- **Sample Size:** Minimum users needed for statistical power

## Template Structure

### 1. Test Planning

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Test Name** | [Descriptive name] |
| **Hypothesis** | [What you're testing] |
| **Success Metric** | [Primary KPI] |
| **Secondary Metrics** | [Additional KPIs] |
| **Duration** | [Test length] |
| **Sample Size** | [Users per variant] |

### 2. Test Setup

| Component | Control (A) | Treatment (B) |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Description** | [Current version] | [New version] |
| **Traffic Split** | 50% | 50% |
| **Target Users** | [User segment] | [Same segment] |
| **Exclusions** | [Any exclusions] | [Same exclusions] |

### 3. Analysis Framework

#### A. Statistical Analysis
- **Confidence Interval:** Range of likely true values
- **P-value:** Probability of observing results by chance
- **Effect Size:** Magnitude of the difference
- **Power Analysis:** Statistical power of the test

#### B. Business Impact
- **Revenue Impact:** Financial implications
- **User Experience:** Qualitative feedback
- **Operational Impact:** Implementation considerations
- **Risk Assessment:** Potential negative effects

## Netflix India Example

### Test: Mobile-Only Pricing Plan

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Test Name** | Mobile-Only Plan Pricing Test |
| **Hypothesis** | Lower-priced mobile-only plan will increase conversion |
| **Success Metric** | Subscription conversion rate |
| **Secondary Metrics** | Revenue per user, churn rate |
| **Duration** | 4 weeks |
| **Sample Size** | 10,000 users per variant |

### Test Setup

| Component | Control (A) | Treatment (B) |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Description** | Standard pricing (₹649/month) | Mobile-only plan (₹199/month) |
| **Traffic Split** | 50% | 50% |
| **Target Users** | Mobile users in India | Mobile users in India |
| **Exclusions** | Existing subscribers | Existing subscribers |

### Results Analysis

| Metric | Control (A) | Treatment (B) | Difference | Significance |
|--------|-------------|---------------|------------|--------------|
| **Conversion Rate** | 12% | 18% | +6% | p < 0.01 |
| **Revenue per User** | ₹649 | ₹199 | -₹450 | p < 0.01 |
| **Churn Rate** | 8% | 12% | +4% | p < 0.05 |

## Best Practices

### 1. Test Design
- **Clear Hypothesis:** Specific, testable hypothesis
- **Appropriate Metrics:** Relevant success measures
- **Sufficient Sample Size:** Adequate statistical power
- **Proper Duration:** Allow for full user cycles

### 2. Execution
- **Random Assignment:** Ensure unbiased groups
- **Data Quality:** Monitor for data issues
- **Test Integrity:** Prevent contamination
- **Documentation:** Record all decisions

### 3. Analysis
- **Statistical Rigor:** Use appropriate tests
- **Business Context:** Consider practical significance
- **Multiple Metrics:** Look at secondary effects
- **Long-term Impact:** Consider sustained effects

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Insufficient Sample Size
- **Problem:** Test underpowered to detect differences
- **Solution:** Calculate required sample size beforehand

### 2. Multiple Testing
- **Problem:** Testing multiple metrics increases false positives
- **Solution:** Adjust significance levels or use multiple comparison corrections

### 3. Selection Bias
- **Problem:** Non-random assignment to groups
- **Solution:** Ensure proper randomization

### 4. Short Test Duration
- **Problem:** Not capturing full user behavior cycles
- **Solution:** Run tests for appropriate duration

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Multivariate Testing
- **Multiple Variables:** Test several changes simultaneously
- **Interaction Effects:** Understand how changes work together
- **Complex Analysis:** More sophisticated statistical methods

### 2. Sequential Testing
- **Early Stopping:** Stop test when significance reached
- **Adaptive Design:** Adjust test based on interim results
- **Efficiency Gains:** Reduce required sample size

### 3. Machine Learning Integration
