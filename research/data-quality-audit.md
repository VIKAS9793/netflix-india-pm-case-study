**⚠️ EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY - NOT AFFILIATED WITH NETFLIX**

**EDUCATIONAL CASE STUDY DISCLAIMER:**
- **Author:** Vikas Sahani (vikassahani17@gmail.com)
- **Purpose:** Educational demonstration of product management research methodologies
- **Nature:** Hypothetical analysis for learning purposes only
- **Data Sources:** Publicly available information only
- **Compliance:** No confidential, proprietary, or insider information used
- **Disclaimer:** This analysis does not represent actual Netflix strategy or business decisions

## Purpose

This document demonstrates how to conduct a data quality audit in product management research, teaching critical thinking skills for distinguishing verified facts from assumptions.

## Audit Methodology

### Step 1: Source Verification
Every data point is categorized as:
- ✅ **VERIFIED:** Official sources, earnings calls, public filings
- ⚠️ **ESTIMATED:** Industry reports, analyst projections
- ❌ **ASSUMPTION:** No supporting data, educated guesses

### Step 2: Confidence Scoring
Each claim receives a confidence score (0.00-1.00):
- 0.90-1.00: Multiple verified sources
- 0.70-0.89: Single verified source
- 0.50-0.69: Industry estimates
- 0.30-0.49: Limited supporting data
- 0.00-0.29: Pure assumption

## Data Quality Issues Found

### Issue 1: Untagged Assumptions
**Problem:** User behavior patterns presented as facts
**Example:** "Users prefer mobile viewing" - no supporting data
**Fix:** Tagged as [ASSUMPTION] with confidence score 0.45

### Issue 2: Unverified Market Projections
**Problem:** Growth projections without methodology
**Example:** "Market will grow 30% annually" - no source
**Fix:** Tagged as [SCENARIO] with confidence score 0.40

### Issue 3: Competitive Analysis Gaps
**Problem:** Competitor metrics from single sources
**Example:** JioCinema subscriber count from one report
**Fix:** Tagged as [ESTIMATED] with confidence score 0.60

## Corrected Data Points

### High Confidence (0.80-1.00)
- Netflix Q3 2024 earnings data ✅
- Disney+ Hotstar subscriber count ✅
- Amazon Prime Video revenue ✅

### Medium Confidence (0.50-0.79)
- Industry growth projections ⚠️
- Competitive market share estimates ⚠️
- User engagement patterns ⚠️

### Low Confidence (0.00-0.49)
- Future revenue projections [ASSUMPTION]
- User preference assumptions [ASSUMPTION]
- Market penetration scenarios [SCENARIO]

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Always Tag Assumptions
**Before:** "Users want regional content"
**After:** "Users want regional content [ASSUMPTION - confidence: 0.45]"

### 2. Provide Source Attribution
**Before:** "Market size is 120M subscribers"
**After:** "Market size is 120M subscribers (Source: Media Partners Asia, 2024)"

### 3. Quantify Uncertainty
**Before:** "Significant growth potential"
**After:** "Growth potential: 15-20% annually [SCENARIO - confidence: 0.40]"

### 4. Distinguish Data Types
- **Facts:** Verifiable, time-stamped data
- **Estimates:** Industry analyst projections
- **Assumptions:** Unverified hypotheses
- **Scenarios:** Modeled projections

## Quality Checklist

### For Every Data Point:
- [ ] Source identified and cited
- [ ] Confidence score assigned
- [ ] Assumption tags applied
- [ ] Date of data collection noted
- [ ] Methodology explained (if applicable)

### For Every Recommendation:
- [ ] Based on verified data
- [ ] Assumptions explicitly stated
- [ ] Confidence level indicated
- [ ] Validation plan included

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Confirmation Bias
**Problem:** Seeking data that supports predetermined conclusions
**Solution:** Actively seek contradictory evidence

### 2. Single Source Dependency
**Problem:** Relying on one data source
**Solution:** Cross-reference multiple sources

### 3. Recency Bias
**Problem:** Overweighting recent data
**Solution:** Consider historical trends and context

### 4. Scale Confusion
**Problem:** Mixing different time periods or markets
**Solution:** Clearly specify scope and timeframe

## Best Practices

### 1. Transparent Documentation
- Document all assumptions
- Explain methodology
- Provide confidence intervals

### 2. Regular Validation
- Update data regularly
- Reassess confidence scores
- Validate assumptions with new data

### 3. Stakeholder Communication
- Clearly communicate uncertainty
- Explain confidence levels
- Provide context for decisions

## Impact on Decision Making

### High Confidence Data (0.80+)
- Safe to base strategic decisions on
- Can be used for planning and forecasting
- Suitable for stakeholder presentations

### Medium Confidence Data (0.50-0.79)
- Use for directional guidance
- Require additional validation
- Include caveats in presentations

### Low Confidence Data (0.00-0.49)
- Use only for hypothesis generation
- Require immediate validation
- Not suitable for strategic decisions

## Conclusion

Data quality auditing is essential for maintaining research integrity in product management. By systematically tagging assumptions, quantifying confidence, and providing transparent documentation, PMs can make more informed decisions and communicate uncertainty effectively.

**Key Takeaway:** It's better to be honest about uncertainty than to present assumptions as facts.
