> **CRITICAL DISCLAIMER: FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY**

This repository contains a **hypothetical product management case study** created as a learning exercise by Vikas Sahani. It is **NOT** based on insider information, proprietary data, or any affiliation with Netflix, Inc.

---

## Why This Matters

**If you're preparing for PM interviews:** Study how to structure product strategy documents, apply RICE scoring, and build validation plans.

**If you're a new PM:** Learn to distinguish assumptions from facts, quantify confidence, and communicate uncertainty professionally.

**If you're teaching PM:** Use these templates and audit process as practical exercises for students.

**If you're a practitioner:** Adapt these frameworks to your own products and learn research methodology.

---

## Quick Start

### Learning Path

```
1. Executive Summary (10 min) → 2. Data Quality Audit → 3. Frameworks → 4. Full Analysis
```

**Step 1:** Read `research/executive-summary.md` first  
**Step 2:** Study `research/data-quality-audit.md` to learn research integrity  
**Step 3:** Explore `frameworks/` for reusable PM templates  
**Step 4:** Read `research/full-case-study.md` for complete analysis  
**Step 5:** Review `research/netflix-india-comprehensive-research.md` for detailed insights

### For Different Audiences

**Students / Learning PM:**
- Focus on methodology over conclusions
- Practice with framework templates
- Study assumption tracking in `data-sources/assumption-log.md`

**Educators:**
- Use `frameworks/` as teaching materials
- Assign data quality audit for critical thinking
- Adapt templates for other case studies

**Practitioners:**
- Review methodology, not conclusions
- Apply frameworks to your own context
- Use as interview preparation material

## What This Is

An educational demonstration of:

- Product management research methodology
- Data quality audit processes
- Strategic framework application (RICE, JTBD, OKRs, North Star metrics)
- How to distinguish verified facts from assumptions
- Quantifying confidence in product decisions
- Building validation plans before execution

## What This Is NOT

- Official Netflix strategy or internal data
- Investment advice or business intelligence
- Ready-to-execute recommendations
- Suitable for commercial decision-making without independent validation
- Claiming insider knowledge or proprietary information

## Key Learning Outcomes

After studying this repository, you should understand:

| # | Learning Outcome | Category |
|---|------------------|----------|
| 1 | **Data Integrity**: How to separate verified facts from assumptions | Methodology |
| 2 | **Confidence Quantification**: Using 0.00-1.00 scales for claims | Research |
| 3 | **Research Audit**: How to identify and correct data quality issues | Quality Assurance |
| 4 | **Framework Application**: RICE, JTBD, OKRs, cohort analysis, etc. | Tools |
| 5 | **Validation Planning**: Building experiments before committing resources | Execution |
| 6 | **Professional Communication**: Presenting uncertainty without undermining strategy | Communication |

---

## How to Adapt These Frameworks for Your Product

The real value of this case study is learning the methodology, not copying the conclusions. Here's how to apply these frameworks to your actual work:

### Step 1: Data Collection
- Use the same verification checklist from `data-sources/assumption-log.md`
- Distinguish between verified facts and assumptions in your research
- Document confidence levels for each claim

### Step 2: Framework Application
- **RICE Scoring**: Replace Netflix India metrics with your product's actual data
- **OKRs**: Adapt the objective-setting structure to your team's goals
- **Cohort Analysis**: Use the template with your retention data
- **A/B Testing**: Follow the experimental design principles

### Step 3: Validation Planning
- Adapt experiment designs to your product context
- Scale confidence scoring to your organization's risk tolerance
- Build iterative validation before full commitment

### Step 4: Communication
- Present uncertainty professionally using confidence scores
- Separate hypotheses from validated insights
- Document assumptions explicitly for stakeholders
