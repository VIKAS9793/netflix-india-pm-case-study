# Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) Framework Template

## Overview
Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) is a framework that focuses on understanding the "job" a customer is trying to accomplish when they use a product or service. It shifts focus from product features to customer outcomes.

## Key Concepts

A job is the progress a customer is trying to make in a particular circumstance. It has three dimensions:

- **Social:** How the customer wants to be perceived

### Job Categories
- **Core Job:** The primary reason for using the product
